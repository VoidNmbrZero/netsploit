# Setup (will be improved):
Add this script to your autoexecute:
```luau
_G.IP = CHANGEME
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoidNmbrZero/netsploit/refs/heads/main/script.lua"))()
```
Where "CHANGEME" is your computer's local ip adress, told to you on netsploit desktop launch.
Rest is obvious.
